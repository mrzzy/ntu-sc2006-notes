# Requirements Elicitation I

Correct requirements ellication is a the **foundation** of a successful project
as it identifies the **purpose** of the software system.

## Requirements Elicitation Process

1. **Identify Stakeholders**
    - Customers
    - Management
    - Developers
2. **Elicit Requirements**
    - from _problem domain_
    - from _customer day to day_ activities.
3. **Validate Requirements** with stakeholders.
    - Customers: check that the requirements are **what they want**.
    - Development team: check that they understand what the requirements entail.

## Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

### Project Mission Statement

Project Mission Statement defines the project in _2-3 sentences_:

- **Problem** scope of the project.
- **Stakeholders** Developers, Customers, Management.
- **Outcomes** benefits of the project.

### Types of Requirements

- **Functional** what _features_ must the system have?
    eg. must be interoperate with another system.
- **Non-functional** what _properties_ must the system have? eg. Usability, Reliablility, Performance, Extensibility, Maintainability

### Good Requirements

Good Requirements are:

- **Atomic** specify **only 1** requirement per requirement statement.
- **Verifiable** clear **testable** goalpost to satisfy requirement.
- **Unambiguious** interpretation of the requirement is not up to debate.
- **Tracable** requirements can be cited by their requirement IDs back to the documents from which they where defined.

## UI Prototype

**UI Prototype** mock up to work out User Experience (UX) of the User Interface (UI)

## Data Dictionary

**Data Dictionary** is a problem domain glossary that **unambiguiously** define terms so that they are not open for interpretation.
