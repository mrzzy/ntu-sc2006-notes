# Requirements Elicitation

Correct requirements ellication is a the **foundation** of a successful [Software Engineering](../introduction/introduction.md) project
as it identifies the **purpose** of the software system.

## Requirements Elicitation Process

1. **Identify Stakeholders**
    - Customers
    - Management
    - Developers
2. **Elicit Requirements**
    - from _problem domain_
    - from _customer day to day_ activities.
3. **Validate Requirements** with stakeholders.
    - Customers: check that the requirements are **what they want**.
    - Development team: check that they understand what the requirements entail.

## Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

### Project Mission Statement

Project Mission Statement defines the project in _2-3 sentences_:

- **Problem** scope of the project.
- **Stakeholders** Developers, Customers, Management.
- **Outcomes** benefits of the project.

### Types of Requirements

- **Functional** what _features_ must the system have?
    eg. must be interoperate with another system.
- **Non-functional** what _properties_ must the system have? eg. Usability, Reliablility, Performance, Extensibility, Maintainability

### Good Requirements

Good Requirements are:

- **Atomic** specify **only 1** requirement per requirement statement.
- **Verifiable** clear **testable** goalpost to satisfy requirement.
- **Unambiguious** interpretation of the requirement is not up to debate.
- **Tracable** requirements can be cited by their requirement IDs back to the documents from which they where defined.

## UI Prototype

**UI Prototype** mock up to work out User Experience (UX) of the User Interface (UI)

## Data Dictionary

**Data Dictionary** is a problem domain glossary that **unambiguiously** define terms so that they are not open for interpretation.

## Unified Modelling Language (UML)

Set of Diagrams for designing Software, **not** a programming language.

- Class Diagram
- Activity Diagram
- Use Case Diagram
- State Machine Diagram
- Communication Diagram

## Use Case

Use Case:

- describes how a user **uses a system** to accomplish a particular **goal**.
- summary of â‰¥1 functional requirements **utilised together** by an **actor**.

## Use Case Model

Use Case Model combines:

- Use Case Diagram
- Use Case Description

## Use Case Diagram

```plantuml
@startuml
left to right direction
actor "Food Critic" as fc
rectangle Restaurant {
  usecase "Eat Food" as UC1
  (UC1) .> (UC2): <<include>>
  (UC3) ..> (UC1): <<extends>>
  usecase "Pay for Food" as UC2
  usecase "Drink" as UC3
}
fc -- UC1
fc -- UC2
fc -- UC3
@enduml
```

### Use Case Diagram Associations

- `<<include>>` large use case includes functionality from smaller use case (arrow side).
- `<<extends>>` use case **optionally** extends functionality of another use case (arrow side).

## Use Case Description

Use Case Description contains:

- **Participating Actors**
    - 1 **initiating actor** triggers the use case.
- **Entry Conditions** start state before the use case begins as a set of conditions.
- **Exit Conditions** end state after the use case ends as a set of conditions.
- **Flow of Events** steps performed in the **successful**/happy path:
    - Actor steps "The Actor ..."
    - System steps "The System ..."
- **Alternative Flows** steps performed on deviations from the successful path.
    - ID format: `AF-[0-9]+` **variations** from successful path.
    - ID format: `EX-[0-9]+` **exceptions** (errors) from successful path.
